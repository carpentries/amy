Thank you for your application for Software Carpentry/Data Carpentry instructor training. Due to high demand, the waiting time for open instructor training events is currently 8-12 months as we try to clear our backlog. If you are affiliated with one of our institutional partners (listed at http://software-carpentry.org/scf/partners), we will do our best to prioritize your application; if you or your institution would like to discuss partnership, we would welcome an opportunity to speak with you.
