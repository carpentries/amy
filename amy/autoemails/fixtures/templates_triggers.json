Helpers do not have to be affiliated with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), and actually being a helper is a great way to introduce others to The Carpentries. In order to assist you, we have developed text for you to use to recruit potential [helpers](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#helper-checklist). \r\n* **Survey Links:** The learner facing survey links are automatically generated on the [workshop's webpage]({{ workshop.url }}). They will be located directly above and within the schedule. You are welcome to share the survey links (located on the workshop webpage) with your attendees whenever the time is right for your workshop. \r\n{% if \"online\" in tags %}\r\n* **Online Teaching:** If you plan to teach/host a workshop online please check out our recommendations for online resources in [our handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html). This official set of recommendations will be updated as we receive feedback from the community. We would welcome [any feedback](https://forms.gle/iKLCdSkzqiHTY2yu5) you may have after teaching online.\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\n{% if short_notice %}\r\nPlease allow a few days to return the links to view the results of the survey.  \r\nFeel free to follow-up if you have any questions or concerns. \r\n{% else %}\r\nI will send out the links to view the results of the survey approximately 1 week prior to the workshop.\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  \r\n\r\nBest,  \r\n{{ assignee }}"

We are not part of this process. This may include airfare, ground travel, hotel, and meals/incidentals. {{ host.personal }}, it is up to you whether you want to book things directly or have instructors make their own arrangements and get reimbursed. Either way, please keep in mind our instructors are volunteering two days of their time to teach with you, so please support them in making travel and reimbursement as smooth as possible.\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\nYou can all read more about the roles of workshop hosts, instructors, and helpers [here](http://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index.html). I\u2019ll highlight a few things here.\r\n\r\n{{ host.personal }}, can you share a little about who your learners are and what you and they are expecting? That will help our instructors be prepared. We also like to have a couple of helpers at each workshop from the local community. Would you be able to help secure a couple of helpers? They don\u2019t need to be connected with us; they just need a good understanding of the technologies we teach and an enthusiasm to help others. {% if \"online\" in tags %}[Here](https://carpentries.org/online-workshop-recommendations/#instructional-roles) are the recommended responsibilities for helpers during online workshops.{% endif %}\r\n\r\n{% if \"online\" in tags %}\r\n{{ instructor1.personal }}, {{ instructor2.personal }}, {{ supporting_instructor1.personal }} and {{ supporting_instructor2.personal }}, please feel free to introduce yourselves and share a bit about your backgrounds.

We value the background and expertise you bring to this, and want to hear about you.\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\n{{ instructor1.personal }} and {{ instructor2.personal }} will divide up the [curriculum]({% if workshop_main_tag == 'SWC' %}https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/{% elif workshop_main_tag == 'DC' %}http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/{% elif workshop_main_tag == 'LC' %}https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/{% endif %}) to know who\u2019s teaching what. One of them will create the workshop\u2019s web page on GitHub, which will include workshop details and instructions on what learners will need to install on their computers. The template can be found [here](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template).\r\n\r\nPlease use the workshop id: {{ workshop.slug }}.\r\n\r\n{{ host.personal }}, if you want to handle registration internally that\u2019s fine. Otherwise I can work with you to create an Eventbrite registration page. I will need to know a total count, the registration fee (if any, as well as a refund policy), and the exact location. Regardless, all learners should complete pre/post workshop surveys which will be available on the web page the instructors create. I will share links so you all can view survey results.\r\n\r\nI will check in over the next few weeks and after it\u2019s all over to hear how it went. Any of you are also welcome to join our instructor discussion sessions before and/or after the workshop. It\u2019s a great way to ask questions and share ideas with other instructors before you teach, and to give us feedback after you teach. Check out the schedule and sign up [here](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions). \r\n\r\nWe are so glad to have everyone confirmed for this. Please email any questions you all may have for us or each other.\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n{{ assignee }}"
