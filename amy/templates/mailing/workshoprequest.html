<p>This email is to confirm that we have received your request for a Carpentries
Workshop! Someone will be in contact with you soon. Below you will find a few important notes:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Organising a workshop requires a minimum of 2 months. If you are requesting a workshop less than 2 months, we cannot guarantee that instructors will be placed by your requested date. We will do our very best to meet your request. If we are not able to meet your request, we do ask that you consider flexible dates.</li>
    <li>There are certain criteria we use when selecting instructors. We pair experienced instructors with newly certified instructors. We ensure that all of our instructors are given an equal opportunity to teach.</li>
    <li>Here are resources that will help you prepare for your online workshop: <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html">resources for online workshops</a>.</li>
    <li>Please be advised that a workshop will not be scheduled until it has been confirmed by both the host and The Carpentries Workshop Administrator. Our workshops are organised based on the order the Workshop Request Form is received and finalized.</li>
</ul>

<p>We look forward to working with you and ensuring you have a great workshop!<br>
The Carpentries</p>
