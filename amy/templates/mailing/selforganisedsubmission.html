<p>
  Thank you for informing us of your self-organised workshop! The workshop
  administrative team or your regional coordinator will follow-up within a week.
</p>

<p>
  Approximately 2 weeks prior to the workshop, please send a reminder to your
  learners to complete the pre-survey and install the necessary software prior
  to the workshop. Feel free to utilize the email template "Email Learners
  before Workshop", found
  in <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html#email-templates">The
  Carpentries Handbook</a>. The survey links for learners are automatically
  generated on the workshop's GitHub page, and typically located above and
  within the schedule.
</p>

<p>
  If you are planning to teach the workshop online, you can look at resources
  that will help you get ready in
  the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/index_online.html">handbook</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Have a great workshop!<br>
  The Carpentries
