This email is to confirm that we have received your request for a Carpentries
Workshop! Someone will be in contact with you soon. Below you will find
a few important notes:

* Organising a workshop requires a minimum of 2 months. If you are
  requesting a workshop less than 2 months, we cannot guarantee that
  instructors will be placed by your requested. We will do our very best to
  meet your request. If we are not able to meet your request, we do ask that
  you consider flexible dates.
* There are certain criteria we use when selecting instructors. We pair
  experienced instructors with newly certified instructors. We ensure that
  all of our instructors are given an equal opportunity to teach. We look at
  the  location of the instructor. We have several factors to consider and
  will try to locate instructors nearby.
* We recommend budgeting $1000 per instructor to cover the cost of
  accommodations (travel, ground transportation, lodging and meals).

We look forward to working with you and ensuring you have a great workshop!
The Carpentries
