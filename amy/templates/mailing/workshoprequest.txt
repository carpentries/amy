This email is to confirm that we have received your request for a Carpentries
Workshop! Someone will be in contact with you soon. Below you will find
a few important notes:

* Organising a workshop requires a minimum of 2 months. If you are
  requesting a workshop less than 2 months, we cannot guarantee that
  instructors will be placed by your requested date. We will do our very best to
  meet your request. If we are not able to meet your request, we do ask that
  you consider flexible dates.
* There are certain criteria we use when selecting instructors. We pair
  experienced instructors with newly certified instructors. We ensure that
  all of our instructors are given an equal opportunity to teach. 
* Here are resources that will help you prepare for your online workshop https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/resources_for_online_workshops.html
* Please be advised that a workshop will not be scheduled until it has been confirmed
  by both the host and The Carpentries Workshop Administrator. Our workshops are organised
  based on the order the Workshop Request Form is received and finalized.

We look forward to working with you and ensuring you have a great workshop!
The Carpentries
