<p>
    Dear {{object.personal}} {{object.family}},
</p>

<p>
    Thank you for applying for The Carpentries Instructor Training program. We're excited to have you as part of our community! If you selected <b>"Profile Creation for Pre-approved Trainees"</b> in your application, please be sure you have <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/training_calendar/index.html">registered for an event via Eventbrite</a>or directly with your affiliated institution. You will receive more information approximately one week before your scheduled training. You may disregard the remainder of this email. If you selected <b>"Open Training Application"</b>, please read on.
</p>

<p>
    Open Training applications are placed in an application queue to be considered for Instructor Training sponsorship by The Carpentries. We rank applications on a rolling basis. We are working to increase our capacity and reduce wait times, but at present expect a delay of at least 1-3 months. If your application is accepted, you will be given a registration code and invited to join an upcoming online instructor training event.
</p>

<p>
    If you have a specific need to be trained sooner (e.g. an upcoming workshop) please let us know. Multiple applicants from a single institution generally will not be invited at once, but may be accepted individually over time. To more rapidly build an Instructor community at your institution, consider becoming a Member. For more information see: https://carpentries.org/membership/ or get in touch with memberships@carpentries.org to learn more about how we can help you make the case at your organisation.
</p>


<p>
    We receive hundreds of applications, and we cannot provide no-cost training for every applicant. Please, don't let that discourage you! We'd like to help you bring workshops and instructor training to your organisation. In the meantime, please get involved!
</p>

In the meantime, please get involved!
