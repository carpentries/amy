  This form serves as the entry point for Instructor Training for two groups:
</p>

<p><b>For trainees selected by Carpentries member organizations or groups that have arranged for training</b>, it serves as a trainee <b>Profile Creation form</b>. This creates an entry in our database and allows us to record attendance and track your progress through the Instructor certification process. Form responses are not reviewed in detail but may be used in programmatic assessment. Please note that this form is separate from event registration. Your site contact will provide you with instructions to register for an Instructor Training event. In response to the first question, please select <i>Profile Creation for Pre-approved Trainees</i> and enter in your provided registration code.  If you do not have a registration code, please enter the name of the institution you are joining through.</p>

<p>
<b>For individuals who wish to apply to our Open Instructor Training program</b>, this form serves as an </b>application</b>. Application responses are reviewed carefully, ranked, and selected to receive Instructor Training sponsored by The Carpentries. After being accepted, your profile is already complete;  it is not necessary to fill out the form a second time.  In response to the first question, please select "Open Training Application."  No code is needed.
