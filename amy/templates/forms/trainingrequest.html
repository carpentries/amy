<p><b>Trainees selected by Carpentries member organizations are asked to complete this <b>Profile Creation form</b>. This creates an entry in our database and allows us to record attendance and track your progress through the Instructor certification process. Form responses are not reviewed in detail but may be used in programmatic assessment. Your application materials and information about your progress towards The Carpentries Instructor certification may be shared with our contacts at your member site. Please note that this form is separate from event registration. Your site contact will provide you with instructions to register for an Instructor Training event. </p>

<p> More details about the Instructor role are available on the <a href="https://carpentries.org/become-instructor/">Become an Instructor</a> page on The Carpentries website. To learn more about what the training will cover, please see our <a href="http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/">Instructor Training curriculum</a>.
