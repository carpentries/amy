## Coding Guidelines

*   Please base your work from `develop` branch, not `main`! `develop`
    contains latest work that will later become a new release, while `main`
    contains latest stable release.
*   All new code must be [PEP8 compatible][pep8], but legacy code should
    not be modified unless its meaning is being changed.
*   Contributors are strongly encouraged to write docstrings that conform
    to [PEP257][pep257].
*   New functionality should be accompanied by unit tests where feasible.
*   All dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

The AMY logo was made using the Bradley Hand font from LibreOffice.
