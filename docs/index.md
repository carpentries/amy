# AMY Documentation

AMY is a database application for The Carpentries.  It allows The Carpentries to track programmatic activity including:

* workshops
* instructor training
* individual roles and badges
* institutional membership

Most functionality is limited to authorized administrative users.  Individuals whose data is tracked in AMY can view only their own profile page.

The code base can be found in the [AMY GitHub repo](https://github.com/carpentries/amy).
