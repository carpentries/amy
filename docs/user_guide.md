User Guide
==========

## Names

Use local names (e.g., Uniwersytet w Białymstoku) for locations rather than
anglicized names (e.g., University of Bialystok), but stick to something close
to the Latin alphabet (no Cyrillic or kanji).

## New users

Only people with admin privileges should be able to log in, so when you create
a new user, even though you've specified a password for that user, they won't
be able to log in.

## May contact

The "may contact" box on the Person record indicates whether we're allowed to
mail people — some people don't want to be contacted.

For this reason, some listings of people don't show emails sometimes (because
people didn't let us contact them).

## Publishing events

Events will be published automatically (with a delay up to 1 hour) on
Software-Carpentry's website when following conditions are met:

* they have a starting date
* they have a URL
* they have location (country, venue, address, latitude and longitude)
