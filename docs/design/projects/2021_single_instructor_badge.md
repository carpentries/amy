# Single Instructor Badge

[GitHub project](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/projects/7).

Series of changes required to drop support for 3 various instructor badges (SWC
instructor, DC instructor, LC instructor), and instead use just one: Instructor.

This project was tied to [Community Roles](./2021_community_roles.md) because once
everyone received a single instructor badge, they were assigned "instructor" community
role.
