# Memberships

[GitHub project](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/projects/2).

This project updated structure of memberships to fit current needs of The Carpentries.

Changes include:

* multiple organisations linked together as a consortium
* memberships can link to multiple organisations
* people can be assigned specific roles in memberships
* memberships can be extended
* memberships can be rolled over, and there's quite a logic related to that and
  calculation of seats available after roll-over.
