# Instructor Selection

[GitHub project](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/projects/6).

This project aims to replace a publicly available spreadsheet used to assign instructors
to workshops. Instead, instructors can log into AMY and see the list of workshops
available to them, sort and filter for their convenience.

AMY admins also received a special feature to manage available workshop applications.
