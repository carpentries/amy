# AMY release v1.6.2

Whoa, another one?! Yesterday we released [v1.6.1][], today it's time for
[v1.6.2][] with some very minor changes.

## New features

* New fields in the training request form:
    * `group name` will enable us to register groups for the training, without
      (for now) the need for a new form
    * `comment` will be a place for any additional information; instead of it,
      people would use `additional skills`.
* `Event.slug` received new help text containing a format description for
  admins to use.  This field's validation was also changed so that it only
  allows entries in this specific format (this is additional to other
  validation done by Django, ie. only latin characters, digits, underscores and
  hyphens allowed).

## Bug fixes

* Migration `0088*`, which was supposed to generate fake slugs for events
  without them, contained an error that we hit in the production, so [Piotr][] fixed it
  by adding random characters to the slugs if uniqueness constraint was about
  to be violated.
