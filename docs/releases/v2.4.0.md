# AMY release v2.4.0 - 2019-01-02

Major AMY [v2.4.0][] was released on 2019-01-02.

This release is sporting a new commenting system that replaces old "notes"
fields on Events, Persons, Organizations, Memberships, Training Requests and
Workshop Requests. The summary of other changes is available below.


## New features
* [Piotr][] enabled resizing for permission box on Person Edit Permissions
  page.
* [Piotr][] changed filtering logic in Find Workshop Staff - now instead of
  conjoining badges (`badge1 AND badge2 AND badge3`), we're summing them
  (`badge1 OR badge2 OR badge3`).
* [Piotr][] added the Library Carpentry tag
* [Piotr][] extended "Instructors num taught" by splitting the summary per
  each tag (SWC, DC, LC, TTT), and adding `country` field.
* [Piotr][] added commenting system, based on former Django Contrib
  application [`django-comments`](https://github.com/django/django-contrib-comments).
  Also the comments support Markdown now.
* [Piotr][] extended "Find Workshop Staff" with CSV download (which required
  a bit of internal changes).
* [Piotr][] extended "Workshops/Learners/Instructors over time" with
  additional filters.


## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] added redirects from old URLs (pre-v2.3.0), to new (v2.3.0+) ones.
