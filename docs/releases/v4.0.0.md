## New features

For complete list of features, please follow project links above and milestone link.

* Community Roles project brings in better defined roles for every person in the
  database. This includes, for example, links to resources they're maintaining, or
  termination reason, along with enablement time period.
* Single Instructor Badge is a migration project, making changes to AMY to drop support
  for Instructor Badges from various Carpentries; instead, a single Badge will exist for
  all instructors.
* Instructor Selection is a project most important for the end users (instructors). It
  implements a list of workshops looking for instructors. This will make the spreadsheet
  where instructors sign up for workshops deprecated.
