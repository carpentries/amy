# AMY minor release v2.5.1

Minor AMY release [v2.5.1][] was issued on 2019-02-13.

This issue concentrated on bringing a relatively big new feature: preserving
checked checkboxes on All Training Requests page. This feature changes the way
training requests are displayed, and what actions admins can take. More details
in the [pull request](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1465).

## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] updated the language registry, fixing the way some languages with
  multiple names are represented (e.g. "Dutch Flemish" -> "Dutch, Flemish").

## New features
* [Piotr][] made (big) changes to the All Training Requests page that include
  preserving checkboxes along page refreshes.
* [Piotr][] added `?next` URL parameter to the `action_required_policy` view,
  thus enhancing its capabilities.
