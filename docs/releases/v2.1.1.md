# AMY minor release v2.1.1

Minor AMY release [v2.1.1][] was issued on 2018-10-06.

It includes various small fixes to either bugs in API, or missed features from
v2.1.0 big labels (instructor training seats in Memberships).

  from `localhost` too.
* [Piotr][] added default ordering on languages.
* [Piotr][] added missing "Open training seat" to bulk-match form on
  All Training Requests page.
* [Piotr][] fixed filtering on Events API endpoint (it was throwing 500 Server
  Error).


## New features
* [Piotr][] added `country` field to Persons API endpoint, and enhanced the
  filter so that it's possible to filter by the country.
* [Piotr][] added `country` field to Events API endpoint filter, and replaced
  old filtering in Published Events API endpoint with that from Events API
  endpoint.
