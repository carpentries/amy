# AMY release v1.11.5

[This release](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestone/46) provides a few
hotfixes discovered after deploying previous
[GDPR release](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/milestone/45).

## Bug fixes

* [Piotr][] fixed a JavaScript bug introduced in v1.11.4, that prevented from
  executing any further JavaScript lines, and therefore disabled Select2 widget
  from loading correctly.
* [Piotr][] reworked query in `export-instructors` endpoint: removed doubled
  instructors, added missing locations due to wrong (main-)query, and added
  `query_params` to the list returned by `OPTIONS` request to this endpoint.
