# AMY minor release v2.4.1 - 2019-01-20

Minor AMY release [v2.4.1][] was issued on 2019-01-20.

It includes fixes related to removal of "Notes" fields from various objects,
and changes to the deployment documentation or Travis continuous integration
testing.

## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] removed "Comment" column from Workshop Request list page, because
  related field was already gone due to introduction of commenting system in
  [v2.4.0][].
* [Piotr][] fixed error related to adding comments when new memberships are
  created - it was supposed to add comments when they are edited.


## New features
* [Piotr][] updated Travis configuration to work with Python 3.7, instead of
  Python 3.7-dev.
* [Piotr][] updated `procedures.md` with information about using Ansible
  Playbooks for AMY deployment.
