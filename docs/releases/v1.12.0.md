* [Piotr][] [incorporated](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1266) [Chris][]'s [fix](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1203) for truncated language names in database.
* [Piotr][] [fixed inconsistencies present in import/update events from URL window](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1267).
* [Piotr][] [fixed & restyled sidebar on numerous pages](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1268) including "Find Workshop Staff"; form size in the sidebar was improved, and so was autocomplete widget's width.

* [Piotr][] [fixed a number of issues related to GitHub Auth](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1281); the PR includes GitHub username validation, checking of user existence via GitHub API, and a fix for "Logging in with GitHub allowed" displayed for users who actually weren't able to login in with GH. Idea of looking up users from GitHub via its API was dropped.
* [Piotr][] [fixed links redirecting to Code of Conduct pages](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1272); other links going to SWC pages or old emails were also updated.
