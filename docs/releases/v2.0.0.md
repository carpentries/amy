# AMY release v2.0.0 - 2018-08-05

Major AMY [v2.0.0][] was released on 2018-08-05.

The most noticeable feature of this release is a refreshed UI look. This was
accomplished thanks to change in AMY internals - we switched JavaScript & CSS
dependencies from [Bower][]
([outdated](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower/)) to
[Yarn][].

## New features

* Starting small, [Piotr][] made improvements to
  [the admin dashboard](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1289) and
  [the person details page](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1290).
* [Piotr][] [added validation](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1295)
  for assigning trainee with progress - now they
  have to be a learner in a training task beforehand.
* [Piotr][] [enhanced](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1297) some
  models and forms with a new field "Country".
* [Piotr][] [added a view](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1300) for
  finding duplicate training requests, and a tool for merging them.
* [Piotr][] [switched](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1302)
  Code of Conduct to a similar one proposed by GitHub.
* [Piotr][] [made some invasive changes to the UI](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1311).
  This is one huge PR and fixes some old issues (see more in linked PR), but
  mostly it should be considered as a UI refresh.
* [Piotr][] [changed](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1313) what data
  is saved on person profile upon accepting that person's training request.
* [Piotr][] [changed](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1314) how
  membership data (due workshops) is counted.

## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] changed a lot of things around training requests. See

  * [#1292](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/issues/1292), Fix explanatory text for Training Application Group Name.
* [Piotr][] [fixed](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1296) a bug
  preventing all eligible trainees for instructor badges to show up in the
  results.
* [Piotr][] [provided](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1301) some fixes
  for bulk-upload (see more details in linked PR).
