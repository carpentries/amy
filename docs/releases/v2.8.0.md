# AMY release v2.8.0

Major AMY release [v2.8.0][] was issued on 2019-06-19, more than two months after previous release v2.7.0.


## New features
* [Piotr][] reworked "Find Duplicate Persons" view, so that now it's using
  a table and radio buttons for selecting merge candidates.
* [Piotr][] also added "mark as reviewed" feature to "Find Duplicate
  Persons", allowing to dismiss possible duplicates until they are updated.
  If they are updated at least 1 minute after "mark as reviewed" timestamp,
  then they will show up on "Find Duplicate Persons" page.
* [Piotr][] added special log file for logging failed login attempts.
  This will be later used for [fail2ban][] to disallow IPs with too many
  failed login attempts.
* [Maneesha][] changed description of host responsibilities agreement
  on the workshop request form.
