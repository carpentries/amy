# AMY release v2.5.0

Major AMY [v2.5.0][] was released on 2019-02-03.

This release brings a bunch of fixes and contributions from other people.

## New features
* [Maneesha][] renamed 'Group Name' to 'Registration Code' in Training
  Requests.
* [Elizabeth][] updated email addresses on the training form page.
* [Piotr][] added searching in comments, as this stopped working when we moved
  from `notes` fields to comments system.
* [Piotr][] added display of badge & award data in membership details.
* [Piotr][] added [Datatables](https://datatables.net/) for tests in one table
  (event tasks).  If it works out, we may add Datatables to other tables in
  AMY.


## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] fixed errors in `fake_database.py` script.
* [Piotr][] fixed migration checking in Travis-CI script; now Travis correctly
  checks for missing migrations as part of the continuous-integration.
* [Maneesha][] fixed `Makefile` and wrong path to `git_version.py` file.

## Maintenance
* [Piotr][] removed Invoice and Profile Update requests - both features haven't
  been used for a long time.
