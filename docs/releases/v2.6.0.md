# AMY release v2.6.0

Major AMY release [v2.6.0][] was issued on 2019-03-05.

## Bugfixes
* [Piotr][] changed (again) the place jQuery is imported in `base.html`.
* [Piotr][] enabled compression of CSS files (CSS maps were rendering
  un-compressed files unusable).
* [Piotr][] reworked the Makefile so that some potentially risky commands don't
  behave in a risky way. More in [#1476](https://github.com/swcarpentry/amy/pull/1476).

## New features
* [Piotr][] parametrized Django Admin URL (so now it's not available under
  '/admin', but somewhere random).
* [Piotr][] added Criterium model (for sending emails regarding workshops in
  specific geographic areas to specific addresses) and Continent model (for
  defining continents). Continents are used in searching (All Events and Find
  Workshop Staff pages).
* [Piotr][] changed wording and behavior of minority questions in Training
  Request form. Now the field doesn't ask for details, and works with automatic
  scoring.
* [Piotr][] extended workshop tags validation to accept split latitude and
  longitude tags. This feature was requested upstream in workshop template
  repository.
* [Piotr][] reworked Training Progress page in two Pull Requests: a warning
  note (regarding missing data) was added, some misleading information and
  links were updated.
* [Piotr][] added Library Carpentry requirements to the training process.
