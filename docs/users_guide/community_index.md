### Instructor Training

Carpentries Instructor trainees can log in to AMY to view their checkout progress towards their Instructor badge.  Due to the structure of our checkout tracking progress, all steps towards checkout may not be included here. If your instructor badge is correctly displayed, you are in good standing. 

Carpentries Instructor trainees can also submit their lesson contribution for checkout directly in AMY.  Read more in the [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/index.html).

### Viewing teaching opportunities

Currently badged and active Instructors can view and sign up for upcoming teaching opportunities at Centrally-Organised workshops by clicking the "View upcoming teaching opportunities with The Carpentries" button at the top of their profile page. This button is available only to currently badged and active Instructors.

The next page will list all upcoming teaching opportunites.  This list can be sorted and filtered by criteria such as country and curriculum.

Instructors can then register their interest in teaching specific workshop.  A workshop administrator will follow up shortly to confirm or decline each instructor.

#### Notes about signing up 

* Instructors will get a warning if they sign up as interested in concurrent workshops or workshops within two weeks of confirmed workshops.  This is to remind Instructors about possible scheduling conflicts and that they may be overextending themsleves.  This does not prevent Instructors from signing up.
* Instructors will be blocked from signing up for workshops if they are already confirmed to teach a concurrent workshop. This is to prevent actual scheduling conflicts.  Instructors may contact workshops@carpentries.org if they are interested in teaching concurrent workshops to discuss scheduling options.
