## Viewing teaching opportunities

Currently badged and active Instructors can view and sign up for upcoming teaching opportunities at Centrally-Organised workshops by clicking the "View upcoming teaching opportunities with The Carpentries" button at the top of their profile page. This button is available only to currently badged and active Instructors.

![AMY Instructor Signup button](images/amy_instructor_signup.png)

The next page will list all upcoming teaching opportunites.  This list can be sorted and filtered by criteria such as country and curriculum.

![AMY Instructor signup filter view](images/upcoming_teaching_opportunities.png)

Instructors can then register their interest in teaching specific workshop.

![AMY Instructor signup form](images/workshop_intersted_signup.png)

A workshop administrator will follow up shortly to confirm or decline each instructor.

### Notes about signing up

* Instructors will get a warning if they sign up as interested in concurrent workshops or workshops within two weeks of confirmed workshops.  This is to remind Instructors about possible scheduling conflicts and that they may be overextending themsleves.  This does not prevent Instructors from signing up.
* Instructors will be blocked from signing up for workshops if they are already confirmed to teach a concurrent workshop. This is to prevent actual scheduling conflicts.  Instructors may contact <workshops@carpentries.org> if they are interested in teaching concurrent workshops to discuss scheduling options.
