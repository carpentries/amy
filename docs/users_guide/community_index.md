### Badges

#### Instructor Badge

Carpentries Instructor trainees can log in to AMY to view their checkout progress towards their Instructor badge. Carpentries Instructor trainees can also submit their lesson contribution for checkout directly in AMY.  Read more in the [Instructor Training curriculum](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout).

#### Other Badges

 Due to the structure of our badge tracking progress, all steps towards other badges (Maintainer, Trainer, etc.) may not be included here. If your badge is correctly displayed, you are in good standing. 

### Community Roles

In addition to badges, The Carpentries also assigns community roles.  These may or may not be connected to badges, and notes whether an indivdiual is currently serving or has previously served in roles such as Instructor, Trainer, Executive Council Member, etc. While badges do not expire, Community Roles will have start and end dates.  

### Viewing teaching opportunities

Currently badged and active Instructors can view and sign up for upcoming teaching opportunities at Centrally-Organised workshops by clicking the "View upcoming teaching opportunities with The Carpentries" button at the top of their profile page. This button is available only to currently badged and active Instructors.

![AMY Instructor Signup button](images/amy_instructor_signup.png)

The next page will list all upcoming teaching opportunites.  This list can be sorted and filtered by criteria such as country and curriculum.

Instructors can then register their interest in teaching specific workshop.  A workshop administrator will follow up shortly to confirm or decline each instructor.

#### Notes about signing up 

* Instructors will get a warning if they sign up as interested in concurrent workshops or workshops within two weeks of confirmed workshops.  This is to remind Instructors about possible scheduling conflicts and that they may be overextending themsleves.  This does not prevent Instructors from signing up.
* Instructors will be blocked from signing up for workshops if they are already confirmed to teach a concurrent workshop. This is to prevent actual scheduling conflicts.  Instructors may contact <workshops@carpentries.org> if they are interested in teaching concurrent workshops to discuss scheduling options.

### Requesting a workshop

We have three public facing workshop submission forms. These can all be accessed from the [workshop forms landing page](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/workshop/). The workshop inquiry form is used to request more information before being ready to request a workshop.  The workshop request form is used to provide details so we can start planning a workshop with you.  The self organized submission form is used for Instructors notifying us they are running their own workshop. After submitting a form, you will receive a copy of the form via email. A member of The Carpentries Workshop Admin Team will follow up with you after receving your submitted form.
