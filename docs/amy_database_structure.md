# AMY Database structure

The primary tables used in AMY (that will appear in most queries) are those that store information on events, persons, memberships, and organizations.  Additional tables provide more information about events, persons, memberships, and organizations.  This information can be useful in writing [SQL queries in redash](https://redash.carpentries.org/queries).

## Primary Tables in AMY

### Events

`workshops_event` - Primary table for all event data.

#### Commonly used fields

* `id` Sequential, automatically assigned integer
* `start` and `end` Event start and end dates

### Term

`consents_term` - Stores all Terms in AMY (i.e. the privary policy). 

#### Archive Behavior

When `Terms` are archived (`archived_at` timestamp is set), that `Term`'s `TermOptions` and `Consents` are archived as well. If the `Term` was required, once archived it is no longer required in AMY.

#### Commonly used fields

* `slug` slug of the term. Used to uniquely identify the term.
* `content` content of the term. This text shown to users when they consent.
* `required_type` determines whether or not a term is considered required for the user or not. If required it will be shown to the user when they log in to consent to.
* `help_text` additional text shown to the user in order to give more context on the term.

### TermOption

`consents_termoption` - Stores all options for a stored `Term` in AMY. `TermOptions` are displayed when the user is asked to consent to a `Term`,
and are considered answer choices for the `Term`.

#### Archive Behavior

When TermOptions are archived (`archived_at` timestamp is set), any `Consents` that rely on that option are archived and a new unset `Consent` is created by AMY for the user. If the `Term` the option was attached to is required, archiving a `TermOption` may result in an email sent to any users who answered with this opition.

#### Commonly used fields

* `term` a required foreign key to term. Unarchived term options attached to a term will be displayed to the user when the term is rendered.
* `option_type` determines whether or not a term option is considered an affirmative aggrement to the term or the user has declined the term.
* `content` the text displayed to the user when the term is rendered.
* `archived_at` - a nullable timestamp

### Consent

`consents_consent` - Stores all consents for all users in AMY. 

#### Archive Behavior

When `Consents` are archived (`archived_at` timestamp is set), a new unset consent is created by AMY.

#### Commonly used fields

* `person` - required foreign key to `Person`.
* `term` - required foreign key to `Term`. Provided for ease of use and reduction of queries. There is a check on the Consent model to ensure the given TermOption belongs to the Term.
* `term_option` - a nullable foreign key to TermOption. When this field is null, the Consent is unset.
* `archived_at` - a nullable timestamp
