AMY is a web-based workshop administration application for [The Carpentries][tc]
and related projects.  Its target audience is workshop
coordinators, most of whom are non-programmers, who need to keep track
of what workshops are being arranged, when they're supposed to occur,
who's teaching what, and so on.

AMY is built using [Django][django] with Python 3, with a bit of Javascript and
other things thrown in.  If you would like to help, please read:

*   the setup instructions below,

*   the [contributor guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), and

*   our [contributor code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please [check with us][contact-address] or open an [issue][issues]
before starting work on new features.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

    ~~~
    $ git clone https://github.com/carpentries/amy.git
    $ cd amy
    ~~~

1.  Configure git to automatically ignore revisions in the `.git-blame-ignore-revs`:

    ~~~
    $ git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
    ~~~

1.  Install [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/):

    ~~~
    $ python -m pip install --user pipenv
    ~~~

1.  Install Python dependencies:

    ~~~
    $ pipenv sync --dev
    ~~~

    **Note:**
    Pipenv will create a new virtual environment for this installation, so you don't
    have to create one yourself.
    The `--dev` flag installs development dependencies, required e.g. for testing.

1.  Install [node][nodejs] for front-end packages management.

1.  Install CSS, JS dependencies with (`npm` was installed in previous step when you
    installed `node`):

    ~~~
    $ npm install
    ~~~

1.  Start running a local instance of Postgres and Redis. This requires Docker to be installed locally.  Redis is required to have certain features (like creating a new person and viewing a workshop request) work correctly.

    ~~~
    $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p amy up -d database redis
    ~~~

1.  Set up your local database with fake (development-ready) data.  This will create a superuser with "admin" as both the username and password.

    ~~~
    $ pipenv run make dev_database
    ~~~

1.  Start a local Django development server by running:

    ~~~
    $ pipenv run make serve
    ~~~

    **Note**:  this also installs front-end dependencies for AMY, including [jQuery][jquery] and [Bootstrap][bootstrap] ([full list here](https://github.com/carpentries/amy/blob/develop/package.json)).

1.  Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/workshops/> in your browser and start clicking. Use the default "admin" as username and password.


1. Shut down the local server by typing `Ctrl-C`.  Shut down the Docker Redis instance with:

    ~~~
    $ docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p amy down
    ~~~

## How to build the docker image?

```shell
$ LAST_COMMIT=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`
$ docker build -t amy:latest -t amy:${LAST_COMMIT} --label commit=${LAST_COMMIT} -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

First command sets `LAST_COMMIT` environment variable to short commit hash of the
last commit in the repository.

Second command builds `docker/Dockerfile` in `.` as a context (should be your repository
directory) with tags `amy:latest` and `amy:LAST_COMMIT`.

## Upgrading

1.  Update the code:

    1.  Get the list of changes:

        ~~~
        $ git fetch
        ~~~

    1.  Look for the newest tag:

        ~~~~
        $ git tag -n
        ~~~~

    1.  Get the code from the newest tag:

        ~~~~
        $ git checkout tags/<tag_name>
        ~~~~

1.  Update dependencies front-end and back-end dependencies:

    ~~~
    $ pipenv run make upgrade
    ~~~

1.  (Optional) make fresh development-ready database:

    ~~~
    $ pipenv run make dev_database
    ~~~

    **Note**:  this command requires removing (by hand) the old database file.

1.  Run database migrations:

    ~~~~
    $ pipenv run python manage.py migrate
    ~~~~

1.  Enjoy your new version of AMY:

    ~~~
    $ pipenv run make serve
    ~~~


## Start hacking on email automation

1. Make sure you have Redis running. See instructions above.

1. Create dev database (it will add a super user and predefined database entries, too!):

    ```shell
    $ pipenv run make dev_database
    ```

1. Run the server:

    ```shell
    $ pipenv run python manage.py runserver
    ```

1. Run the RQ worker and scheduler (use separate terminals or processes for each
   command):

    ```shell
    $ pipenv run python manage.py rqworker
    $ pipenv run python manage.py rqscheduler
    ```
## Run accessibility tests locally

Accessibility tests are run with [Google Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) and [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org) as part of the CI process. It's sometimes helpful to run these programs locally to debug or test changes. For more information on the tests, see the [accessibility tests documentation](docs/accessibility_testing.md)

For both Lighthouse and pa11y tests, Google Chrome or Chromium must be installed. On Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo apt install google-chrome-stable
```

### Lighthouse

Uses [lighthouse-ci](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) with configuration defined in [lighthouserc.js](./lighthouserc.js).

Ensure Chrome is on the path by setting the `CHROME_PATH` environment variable.

```shell
npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.12.x puppeteer
export CHROME_PATH=/path/to/chrome
lhci autorun
```

Lighthouse will exit with a failure code if accessibility failures are found. Reports are stored in the `lighthouse-ci-report/` folder.

### Pa11y

Uses [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci) with configuration defined in [.pa11yci](./.pa11yci).

Change `executablePath` in .pa11yci to point to your Chrome installation.

```shell
npm install -g pa11y-ci pa11y-ci-reporter-html
pa11y-ci
```

Pa11y will exit with a failure code if accessibility failures are found. Reports are stored in the `pa11y-ci-report/` folder.
