[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) is now running three events a week.
That number could double by the end of 2015
but only if we can
[streamline setup and organization](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-workshop-organization.html).
The goal of this project is to build
a web-based workshop administration application using Django to do that.
It is not intended to be visible to the general public,
or even to instructors (at least initially --- we may add that later).
Instead,
the target audience is administrators,
most of whom are non-programmers,
who need to keep track of
what workshops are being arranged,
when they're supposed to occur,
who's teaching what,
and so on.

To get started:

1.  Install Django and its dependencies. You can `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you're using virtualenv. 

2.  Setup your local database.  There are two ways you can do this.

    1. If you have access to the legacy data:

        1. Create an empty database by running:

           ~~~
           make migrations
           ~~~

        2. Fill that database by running:

           ~~~
           make import
           ~~~

    2. Otherwise set up the redacted data with:

       ~~~
       make database
       ~~~

3.  (Optional): Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/), then run:
    
    ~~~
    make bower
    ~~~

    This will install a few required frontend libraries locally. This step is optional because the libraries are loaded from an external CDN by default.

4.  Start a local Django development server by running:

    ~~~
    python manage.py runserver
    ~~~

5.  Open [http://localhost:8000/workshops/](http://localhost:8000/workshops/) in your browser and start clicking.

Amy's data model is mostly done.
What it needs now is views and controllers
so that workshop organizers can inspect, add, and correct data.
If you'd like to help,
please fork this repository and send a pull request,
or contact [Greg Wilson](gvwilson@software-carpentry.org).

Note:
if you are new to the project,
anything at all is welcome as a way of familiarizing yourself with the code.
After that,
please concentrate on features marked `essential` in the issue tracker
so that we can get this into service in January 2015.
Better layout,
incremental page updates via AJAX,
and things like that can all be left until we have something that actually works.
